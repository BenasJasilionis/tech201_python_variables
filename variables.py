# Variables  # Python is a dynamically packed language, meaning you dont need to state the data type

# variable_name = variable_data

a = 1 #int
b = 2 #int
c = 3.5 #float
hi = "Hello World!" #string


# CTRL + / to comment out all selected lines

# print(hi)
# print(a)

# print(1 + 2)
# print(a + b)

# the type method - states data type of the variable

# print(type(hi))

# Overwriting variables
# print(a)
# a = 4
# print(a)


# Getting user input
# print("Hi, what is your name?")
# name = input()
# print("hi")
# print(name)

# Make a program that takes the users name, age and dob and prints them back out
print("Hi, what is your name?")
name = input()
print("hi")

print("How old are you?")
age = input()
print("Me too")
